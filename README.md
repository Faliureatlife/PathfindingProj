An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple. Anyway, an idiot, anything the more complicated something is the more he will admire it. If you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it, he's going to think you are a god because you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That's how they write journals and academic journals. They try to make it so complicated people think you're a genius. - Terry Davis
